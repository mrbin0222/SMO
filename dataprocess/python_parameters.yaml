# below are the explanations for these parameters:
# cell phenotype:
# 1. **selblock_orientation**：the orientation of the selected block, usually used to define the rotation angle of the cell.
# 2. **cell_size**：the size of the cell, usually represented as the length of the long axis of the cell.
# 3. **cell_eccentricity**：the eccentricity of the cell, defining the shape of the cell, the closer to 1, the closer to an ellipse, the closer to 0, the closer to a circle.
# 4. **morph_dev**：the morphological deviation, used to introduce random variations in cell morphology.
# 5. **rat_nuc_cell**：the ratio of the nucleus to the cell size, defining the size of the nucleus relative to the cell.
# 6. **polarity**：the polarity of the cell, affecting the position of the nucleus within the cell.
# these parameters are used to simulate the morphology and behavior of cells, so that they can be analyzed or predicted in a specific environment.
# example parameters
# Stromal cells, Tumor cells, Stromal-Immune, Lumen, Stromal fibers
